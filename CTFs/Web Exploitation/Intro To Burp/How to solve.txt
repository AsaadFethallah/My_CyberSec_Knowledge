- Here, we'll use a tool called "BurpSuite"...
- In This tool, we go to the proxy field to intercept requests, we click on "Open the browser" button, in that new browser, we put the website URL, we submit a request then click "Forward".
- We submit any OTP value, we go to BurpSuite, wipe the last line that says "OTP=___"  
- And click Forward.
