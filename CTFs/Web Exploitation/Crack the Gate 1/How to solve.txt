So here when we entered to the website, we visualise it's code body in the DevTools (Inspect), we can see a hashed text, 
we use decryption of Rot13 (Each character moved by 13 positions), we find a message saying (X-Dev-Access: yes) which is a web request header.

Then we attempt a wrong login request, and so we take it's headers, we copy them and then we modify the headers by adding this X-Dev-Access: yes, 
we get a 200 response of login successful, if we analyse the response's headers, we find the flag.
