So actually, in this challenge, we download the gzip file in our Linux machine.
We unzip it using the gunzip command
Then, if we check the hints of the ctf challenge, they say strings.
strings is a command, that allows us to read readable text from binary files

so we put this command : strings unziped_file_name | grep picoCTF

and we get our flag.
