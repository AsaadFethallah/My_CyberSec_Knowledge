So basically, this CTF is a song...
Once you run the nc command, it displays the lyrics of the song...
Then it gets an input saying " Crowd: " where we must write something...
If we write Refrain it just repeats the same lyrics...
We can write RETURN (Line number of the song)
The flag is hidden in the first verse of the song...
So we write ";RETURN 1"...   (; To block anything before)...
So that the crowd sings the flag...
