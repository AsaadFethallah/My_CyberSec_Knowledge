# NetDiscover
- A tool used to scan devices inside a network.
- We use this command :
sudo netdiscover -r [Ip_address with the mask] (like for example : 192.168.11.1/24)
We put 1 at the end, so that we say to netdiscover to scan the first IP address and then keep incrementing the IP, and if it finds a device with that IP it lists it.

# Nmap
- For the nmap part, look at the pentesting notes in the HackTheBox folder.
- To use nmap for device scanning, we use this command:
sudo nmap -sn [Ip_address with the mask] (like for example : 192.168.11.1/24)

- To scan more securely, add -sS after nmap word in the command.


# Zenmap
- Nmap but graphical.
- When you choose the type of scan, it gives you also the nmap command to use that type of scan.
