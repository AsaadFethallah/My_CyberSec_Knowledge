- We can use a tool called "WhoisLookUp", we go to "https://whois.domaintools.com/":
![[Pasted image 20260118122801.png]]
- And then we put a website URL, and it gives us some infos about it...
- Let's try on TryHackMe:
![[Pasted image 20260118122854.png]]
- And here's some valuable info:
![[Pasted image 20260118122958.png]]

- There is another tool called "Netcraft", it gives us more details than whoisdomaintools, as it gives us also the technologies used in that website (JavaScript, SSL...)
- We write "https://sitereport.netcraft.com" : 
![[Pasted image 20260118123833.png]]
- And we search for example for tryhackme:
![[Pasted image 20260118123859.png]]
- And here is some info:
![[Pasted image 20260118123916.png]]
- And here are some technologies:
![[Pasted image 20260118123955.png]]
- And now, for info related to DNS, we use "robtex.com"
![[Pasted image 20260118124732.png]]
- So basically : 
- DNS = Takes a name and translates it into it IP Address
- Reverse DNS = Takes an IP address and translates it into all server names with that IP
- The idea here is, even if can't reach a website, we can reach it from another website from the same server as an alternative method...
- And here we find them using Robtex...
- We can also use sub-domains as an alternative if we can't reach a website:
![[Pasted image 20260118125041.png]]
- And in order to know the sub-domains of a website, we can use a Kali tool called "knockpy"
- Here, we'll test on Google:
![[Pasted image 20260118130638.png]]
- And here are some subdomains:
![[Capture d’écran (3175).png]]
- Now, we'll see the files that make that website (Like index.html, index.php, script.js...)
- They contain valuable infos, so we'll use a Kali tool called "dirb", itsearches all files of a server in which a website is made of...
![[Pasted image 20260118131911.png]]
- And here are the files:
![[Pasted image 20260118132038.png]]
- And so we can write those URLs with those files in the search bar and we access those hidden pages found by "dirb"
- Those hidden pages are files... (As we know)
