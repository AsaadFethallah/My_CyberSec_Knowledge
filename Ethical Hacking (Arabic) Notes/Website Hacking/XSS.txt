- What is XSS?
![[Pasted image 20260120120422.png]]
- To be clear, this attack concerns only clients in that website, not the website itself...
- XSS Attacks types:
- First, we have: Stored XSS
![[Pasted image 20260120120509.png]]
- Whenever, the client is on the page, the javaScript code that we put starts working...
- Second, we have: Reflected XSS
![[Pasted image 20260120120747.png]]
- Here, it activates once the user clicks a link made by the XSS Attacker...
- Last, we have : DOM Based XSS
![[Pasted image 20260120120903.png]]
- No need for the website to connect with the server...
- So, to check if there are JavaScript vulnerabilities in a website, we can use this method of writing a JavaScript line code in a form for example:
![[Pasted image 20260120121352.png]]
- Here, in this code, we can see that it is being manipulated in the URL:
![[Capture d’écran (3202).png]]
- So basically, this is the key to the Reflected XSS Attack...
- Now for the Stored attack, it's the same thing, just that it doesn't concern URL link, it concerns something within the page itself...

- The interesting thing here is, that once we execute that JS Code, whoever enters this page, will automatically execute that code...
- So here, in order to seize control of a user machine, we can put that "Beef" application script code that they give us once we run it and put it in that form:
![[Capture d’écran (3205).png]]
![[Capture d’écran (3206) 1.png]]
- And so whoever enters this page connects to my kali machine IP, therefore he appears in my BEEF app so I can manipulate him:
![[Capture d’écran (3207).png]]
- So one of the main solutions here, is to transform any text inserted in a form into "Text" even if it has the words "<script>"...
