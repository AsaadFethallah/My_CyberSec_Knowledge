- So basically, this is an attack that applies on Websites using SQL in their databases...
- We can manipulate commands to achieve what we want

- So basically, here's a classic attack on weak websites that use php...
- When we want to do an Authentification, the php code executes this command:
![[Capture d’écran (3189).png]]
- And so if we add another ', which is a syntax error, it can showcase to us the problem and with which request...
- Once we confirm the request line, and how it is written, we can manipulate the command from the form...
- How? So basically, it is known that in a SQL command, if we put #, anything after it is ignored...
![[Capture d’écran (3190).png]]
- Here, in the form, we'll write in the username field hacker'#, if we write anything in the password it wouldn't matter, because we tricked the username field into executing the command that is above...
- Another trick, is that we put beside the password check this quote "OR 1=1", here we say that the username must be "hacker" AND either the password should be 123456 or 1=1, and since 1=1 is true, then it succeeds...

- In the form we write : [Any word as password]' OR 1=1#'
- And so once we click on submit, it checks the password field as either the correct password or 1 must equal 1 in order to grant access...
- Now, for SQL Injection in URLs, we can manipulate URLs, especially if they use GET method...
- Note : # is %23 in URL
- Space = %20
- So basically, we can just do %23 for the password part, and just enter a username

- So basically, there is a tool called "sqlmap", it makes all of this way more easier, it scans a Website URL to see if there are any SQL vulnerabilities, and it tells us all info, even what DB is being used...

- Here are some info we can get, it even tells us that the username field is vulnerable:
![[Capture d’écran (3194).png]]
- And so using the help, here are some actions that we can easily using the tool:
![[Pasted image 20260119165628.png]]
- One way to protect ourselves from SQL Injection attacks is this:
![[Capture d’écran (3196).png]]
- We use that safe method where in the execute command, when we put array it counters that additionnal ' scheme...
