- Bascially, it's the same thing as we did for Windows using the Backdoor (Payload file)...
- Here, for example, instead of an .exe file, we'll use an .apk file

- For Android, we need to do signatures in our payload, so we configure Java in our terminal like this:

- We need also to install "zipalign"

- Now we need to put a certificate in our Android app:
- We'll use this text:

- ![[Pasted image 20260117124216.png]]
- We choose a password
- Now, we use the second command to put a signature to our .apk file
![[Pasted image 20260117124148.png]]
- Of course, we change the name of the app
- We use the zipalign, to make the app load faster and not take many space, the final product (file) is the one we're sending to the target:

- And so we send it to him with multiple ways, and keep listening, once we get a signal that it caught him, we exploit...
