- We need a physical tool called "Alfa Adapter" or another company named "Panda Adapter", basically, it's a device that listens to networks (scan them)

- Handshake is a process used to establish a connection between two devices or systems before actual data transmission begins. 
It ensures that both sides are ready to communicate and agree on the parameters of the communication (such as protocol versions, encryption, and data format). 
(For example, when a computer communicates with a router)

- So, in Kali, we plug our adapter, then we put the command "iwconfig" to see the ports, 
when we detect the port in which our adapter is connected to, we write the command "sudo airmong-ng start [port_name]", it starts scanning.

- To check if it actually started, we need to retype "iwconfig", this time, we'll find "mon" next to the port, it means it's scanning. (Mode Monitor)

- Once plugged in and running, we use this command "sudo airodump-ng [port_name_mon]" to scan nearby networks.

- When we find our target network, we note the following infos in a file: (Channel & mac address).

- So now, we must create the handshake file, we use this command: "sudo airodump-ng [portmon] -w [path_to_file] -c [channelName] -bssid [mac_address]".

-  (In another terminal) Now, we have to disconnect anyone in the network using this command: 
"sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a [network_mac_address] [port_name_mon] [port_name_mon]"

- And so, we find many files (csv, cap...) we take the cap file and try to compare it with a text file having many possible passwords. 
(using this command : "sudo aircrack-ng [capfFle] -w [textFile]) .
